I am 23, have an insatiable love for technology and am an automotive enthusiast. 
I currently work as an ICT Technician (operations and support) for a bustling local business. 
I enjoy tinkering with old computers and servers, giving them a new lease on life as part of my growing home lab. 
When I am not fixing or refurbishing old computer equipment, I am socialising with close friends over video games or cars. 

### Video Games I Enjoy

- Call of Duty (Which ever one is the current release but I also frequent the older games using the plutonium mod)
- Minecraft (Modded and Vanilla)
- Forza Horizon
- Destiny 2 (I have been absent from the game for a while but still adore the franchise and enjoy pouring over it every once in a while)
- GTA V

### Cars I have owned (in order)

- 1990 Mitsubish Lancer GXL
- 1995 Toyota Levin BZG (4AGE BT Manual)
- 2003 Ford Mondeo 
- 1996 Toyota Levin BZR (4AGE BT Manual)
