Hello World!

Firstly, welcome to my blog. 
I have an insatiable love for technology, and a passionate car guy. 
I currently work as an ICT Support Technician (operations and support) for a bustling local business. 
I enjoy tinkering with old computers and servers, giving them a new lease on life as part of my growing home lab. 
 I also like to socialize with close friends over video games or cars. 

I intend on updating this blog when I have spare 30 minutes. 


### Video Games I Enjoy

- Call of Duty (The one is the current release, I also frequent the older games using the plutonium mod).
- Minecraft (Modded and Vanilla)
- Forza Horizon
- Destiny 2 (I  still adore the franchise and enjoy poring over it every once in a while).
- GTA V
