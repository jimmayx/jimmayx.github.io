Last week, I got to participate as the sole pit crew memeber for my friends first competition race at our local race track. It was an exillerating experience - even if I didn't get a chance to be behind the wheel. I have been passionate about motor vehicles and all things fast for a while now but as I was laxidaisically day-dreaming about the events of the weekend, I began to wonder when it all started. 
I haven't always been a speed demon - if you have ever witnessed me do any form of physical exercise "speed demon" is not an accurate descriptor of what you would witness. I wasn't like a lot of the more masuline peers I befriended at school. Some of my peers were into motorcross, others were into bathurst and motor vehicle racing. I thought that they "looked cool" but I wasn't bothered enough to spectate, let alone participate.
Car racing video games were the only hint that I had a hidden passion for all things automotive. Those were the peak years for modern-classic games like Need For Speed: Underground 1/2 and  Midnight Club: Dub Edition. Those games caught my interest and allowed me to explore the foreign concepts of automotive work more-so than I would have ever dreamed. 
I got my first taste of driving when I was a young lad; my dad would meet me and my brother at the corner of our street, 1 block away from home, and would let my brother and I take turns each day sitting on his lap and steer his work vehicle home. Of course this was dangerous but my Dad had control of the speed and could step in if we went a bit crazy. I would have been around 8-9 when this tradition started and it only went on for a few years. 
My next taste was when my Dad and I were in town getting some supplies from a hardware store. After getting the suppplies we needed, my Dad pulled into the wharf area. For those unfamaliar with Dunedin, the wharf area is a hotspot for learner drivers as it is quiet in the weekend and has long, wide roads. My Dad pulled into the shoulder and got me to practice taking off in a manual. I was barely letting the clutch out and moving but this gave me a hint at what was yet to come. I did this for about 5 minutes and then my Dad took control again.
