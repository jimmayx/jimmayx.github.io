This blog was an idea of mine so I had an outlet for me to share the ramblings in my head with the world. I had planned on doing bi-weekly updates and even had some ideas in the drafts that just needed fleshed out some more. 

**Then I got a bit busy.**

Busy is good, busy is great; I have achieved so much more than what I had planned and managed to stay out of trouble. *Mostly.*

What I have decided is this post is going to be a bit of an outline for something I want to push out by the end of the year. By making this post I can at least be held accountable - at least my mother reads these.

For starters, I want to make a post about my cars. I want to go in depth about how I got into the automotive scene and how my attitude has changed over the years. I also want to go into my car history, current cars, and plans I have for the future.

I want to make another post about my tech at home - the fun tinkering projects I have.

Ultimately this will come down to motivation and effort on my part but I want this blog to be a fun exercise I can look back on later in life.

Thank you for taking the time to read this ramble - I hope you will be back in two(ish) weeks for an actual detailed post.
