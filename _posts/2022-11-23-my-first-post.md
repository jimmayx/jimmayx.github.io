Hello World!

Firstly, welcome to my blog. I intend on updating this semi-frequently when there is a spare 30 minutes for me to create a post. 

I will link off to my about me for more information but I feel like I would be doing this a disservice if I didn't explore the reasons for creating a blog. After all, it's not 2005 anymore! 

This blog will serve multiple purposes for me.
1. A creative outlet to channel a part of me I have always wanted to explore - writing a piece that others can read and enjoy.
2. A way of documenting my trials and tribulations in a fun and non-trivial way for me to look back on,
3. An opportunity to share my experiences with someone out there that may also have similar sentiments or struggling with the same set of challenges. 

While this blog may only be a small glimpse into my life, I want anyone who takes the time out of their day to read this, to feel like they have gained some value in reading this. I want my posts to have a sense of belonging and reasoning for existing. I could easily shelter my life from the prying eyes of the general public like I am so used to.
